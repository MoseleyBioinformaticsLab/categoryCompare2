#' annotation class
#' 
#' This class holds an annotation object that defines how annotations relate to
#' features, as well as various pieces about each annotation
#' 
#' These objects may be created by hand, or may result from specific functions
#' to create them. Most notably, this package provides functions for creating
#' a Gene Ontology annotation.
#' 
#' @slot annotation_features list of annotation to feature relationships
#' @slot description character vector providing descriptive text about the annotation
#' @slot counts numeric vector of how many features are in each annotation
#' @slot links character vector defining html links for each annotation (may be empty)
#' @slot type a one word short description of the "type" of annotation
#' 
#' @export

#' statistical results class
#' 
#' This class holds the part of an enrichment that is the statistical results.
#' It has two pieces, a \code{list} of \code{statistics} that is a named list
#' with the actual numerical results of applying the statistics. The other piece
#' is the \code{annotation_id} vector defining which entry in each vector of the
#' \code{statistics} is.

#' @slot statistic_data list of numerical statistics

#' @slot features the "features" of interest, a vector of class ANY

#' significant annotations
#' 
#' The \code{significant_annotations} class holds which annotations from which
#' enrichment were both \strong{measured} and \strong{significant}. Each of these
#' slots is a \emph{logical matrix} with rows named by \emph{annotation_id} and 
#' columns named by the names of the \linkS4class{enriched_result} that was combined.

#' @slot significant logical matrix
#' @slot measured logical matrix
#' @slot sig_calls character representations of calls used to filter the data

#' combined statistics
#' 
#' holds the results of extracting a bunch of statistics from a \linkS4class{combined_enrichment}
#' into one entity. This is useful because we want to enable multiple data representations and
#' simple filtering on the actual \code{data.frame} of statistics, and this provides flexibility
#' to enable that.
#' 
#' @slot statistic_data a \code{data.frame} of all of the statistics from all of the enrichments
#' @slot significant a \linkS4class{significant_annotations} object, that may be empty
#' @slot which_enrichment a \code{vector} giving which enrichment each column of the statistics came from
#' @slot which_statistic a \code{vector} providing which statistic each column contains
#'

#' combined enrichments
#' 
#' The \code{combined_enrichment} class holds the results of combining several 
#' \linkS4class{enriched_result}s together, which includes the original 
#' \linkS4class{enriched_result}s, as well as the \code{annotation_graph}
#' and combined \linkS4class{annotation} objects.
#' 
#' @slot enriched list of enriched objects

#' cc_graph
#' 
#' A \code{cc_graph} class is a \code{graphNEL} with the added slot of
#' \code{significant}, a matrix of rows (nodes / annotations) and whether
#' they were found to be significant in a given enrichment (columns). This
#' matrix is used for classifying the annotations into different groups, and
#' generating either pie-charts or coloring the nodes in a visualization.
#' 
#' @slot significant numeric matrix of ones and zeros

#' node_assign
#' 
#' The \code{node_assign} class holds the unique annotation combinations and the

#' 
#' @slot groups the unique groups, as a logical matrix
#' @slot assignments named character vector providing association with groups
#' @slot colors named character vector of hex colors for groups or experiments
