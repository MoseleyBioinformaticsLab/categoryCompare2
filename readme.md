# categoryCompare2

A Bioconductor package for meta analysis of high-throughput datasets using 
enriched feature annotations instead of just the features themselves.

Note that this is a rewrite of the categoryCompare package. As of May 28, it is still only available from Github, but is expected to eventually be part of `Bioconductor`.
